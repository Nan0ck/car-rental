                    <p>You will need to take your driving licence with you to pick up your hire car.

                      Hire car companies expect drivers to have held their full licence for at least two years. Provisional licences aren’t accepted.

                      When you hire a car abroad in some countries you will need an International Driving Permit, as well as your own driving licence. The Rental Voucher we will send you once you book will let you know if you need one for your trip.</p>

                      <p>Know Your Insurance Coverage:<br>Be sure to research the insurance coverage available on your current automobile policy, your credit card agreement and your homeowners or renter's policy prior to picking up your rental car. This will help you make the most informed decision about optional coverages offered at the rental counter.<br><br>
                        Inspect the Condition of Your Rental Car:<br>Take a walk around your rental car with an agent before you leave the rental location. Be sure to make note of any scratches, dents, dings, etc. and report them so there is no confusion regarding the car’s condition upon return.<br><br>
                        Get to Know the Features on Your Rental Car:<br>Take a few minutes before you leave the rental location to familiarize yourself with where everything is on your rental car. Check the headlights, hazards, windshield wipers, door locks, spare tire, etc.<br><br>
                        Look at a Map Before Leaving the Airport:<br>Be sure to ask the agent at the rental counter for directions or a map of the area. Most rental car companies provide free maps as a courtesy.<br> <br>
                        Avoid Additional Charges at Drop-off:<br>Be sure to return your rental car at the designated date and time on your rental agreement to avoid extra day and/or extra hour charges. If you do not opt to pre-purchase gas at the rental counter, be sure the gas tank is full upon return to avoid gas and re-fueling fees.</p>
